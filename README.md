# Raw Materials, Organisms, Yields, and Cultivation Methods Database

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive database for raw materials, microorganisms, product yields, and cultivation methods. The database was compiled based on the reviews by Quijano et al., 2024, Lahiri et al., 2021, Hussain et al., 2019 and Dourado et al., 2016. It contains key information on feedstocks, microbial strains, process conditions, and expected outputs.

## Features

Raw Materials: Includes information on various carbon and nitrogen sources, including industrial waste streams and agricultural by-products.

Microorganisms: Details different bacterial and fungal strains.

Yields: Reports product yields in g/L. It should be noted that the production volume and cultivation time impacts the yield significantly. 

Cultivation Methods: Distinguishes between static fermentation and agitated cultivation. In the case of agitated cultivation, reactor type and agitation rate is given if known.
